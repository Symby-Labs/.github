## Symby

The exponential rise in academic publications each year has not corresponded with a surge in novel findings; rather, it has 
resulted in the undue formalization of existing literature, favoring papers with established authorship or prestigious institutional 
affiliations. This has led to a halt in substantive progress, the irreplicability of academic findings, and researchers unable to 
keep up with the rate of new research.

Symby is a comprehensive research platform that employs AI to map the scientific landscape, streamline paper replication, propose 
novel hypotheses, and enhance collaborative research. With Symby, you're not just sifting through a vast ocean of research; you're joining the 
first platform dedicated to meta-scientific tooling made to revolutionize the research lifecycle.

The Symby platform is focused on providing eight primary features: 

- A large-scale knowledge graph of scientific concepts
- AI-assisted automatic paper replication
- Hypothesis generation
- Collaborative platform for undertaking science
- A sophisticated feedback pipeline for encouraging perpetual user-based QA/QC
- AI-assisted peer review for extant and pre-print papers
- AI-assisted literature analysis for automating the survey reference creation process
- Real-time research trend analysis
